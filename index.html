        <h2>How to Link Local Directory to Github</h2>

        <p>

            First things first before you start a new project 
            you should link your local directory to your github 
            account. This will allow others to see the work you 
            have created as well as it can be a way to show possible 
            employers the skills you have and how far you have come.
            Here are the steps to link a local directory to a Github 
            account as well as how to transfer the files to your 
            github account.

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make a new directory where all the files and work
                    should be stored on your local computer.Name it
                    something easy to remember, and avoid capital
                    letters and spaces.</li>
                <li>After making the directory on your local computer
                    you should link it to your Github account to allow others
                    to see the work you have created. To link your local 
                    directory to your github directory first cd into the 
                    directory you would like to link. Then create a new
                    directory in Github and name it the same thing you
                    named the directory on your local computer.</li>
                <li>After you cd into the chosen directory write "git init" ,
                    into the local directory. After that write "git add ." 
                    Then "git commit -m "*insert commit name here"".
                </li>
                <li>After doing all of that you can link the two directories
                    like so, type in git remote add origin followed by the 
                    URL provided at the top of the screen of the new directory 
                    on Github. Then type "git push -u origin main", and all the
                    files from your local directory should have been pushed to 
                    your linked Github account.
